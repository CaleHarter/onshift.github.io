    I'm a Systems Engineer on Don't Panic (Ops Team) at OnShift. I was hired in March of 2015 as a developer on the Integrations Team and have moved over to the Ops Team as needs arose. I had a background as a full-stack PHP developer and bit of Operations experience before moving to OnShift. I now have plenty of experience with Ansible, Amazon Web Services, and various different types of hosting technologies.
